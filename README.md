## Overview
With 11 years of dedicated experience in the e-commerce realm, I played a pivotal role in shaping the Everlane tech stack and assembling the Engineering, Product, and Design team from the ground up. It's been some of the most fun, challenging, and formative years of my life. I've achieved significant milestones in my time—created a POS, moved our front end stack from Backbone/JQuery to React and NextJS, created a Ruby on Rails API layer. I've pitched and built both successful and failed web products and features, I've broken production, I've fixed both my own bugs and the bugs of the team. Most importantly my growth has been closely tied to collaborative efforts, fostering an environment of trust and humility. I take pride in contributing to a culture that prioritizes progress for the betterment of the product and valuing the collective journey over individual accolades. I can't begin to put my experiences and contributions into just a few words but I can say that I love what I do and what we've done together.
